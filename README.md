# divided-ogg-midi-js-soundfonts
Modified midi-js-soundfonts to only include OGG Base64 files divided into JSON by respective notes

I've taken the OGG soundfont javascript files found in https://github.com/gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts and divided each note into it's own instrument folder and json file. This allows the browser to retrieve only the notes that are used.
